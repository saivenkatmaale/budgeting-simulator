# Budgeting Simulator

## Project Overview
The **Budgeting Simulator** is a web-based tool developed for the "Hack the System" hackathon, specifically targeting **Track 1: Hack the Economy**. This project aims to enhance financial literacy by allowing users to input their monthly income and expenses, calculate their savings, and receive educational tips on financial concepts like taxes, inflation, and loans. Itâ€™s a simple, interactive application designed to make economics more accessible to everyone.

## Features
- **Real-Time Calculations**: Instantly computes savings and savings percentage based on user inputs.
- **Educational Tips**: Provides tailored financial advice (e.g., cutting costs if expenses exceed income, or investing wisely if savings are strong).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, responsive design built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **No Backend Required**: Fully static, making it easy to host and share.

## How to Use
1. Open the app in a web browser (e.g., [hosted link](#) once deployed).
2. Enter your monthly income and expenses in the provided fields.
3. Click "Calculate Budget" to see your savings breakdown and a financial tip.
4. Test edge cases (e.g., negative numbers) to see input validation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structures the web page.
- **CSS**: Styles the interface for a polished look.
- **JavaScript**: Handles calculations and dynamic content.
- **Hosted on**: GitHub Pages for easy access.
